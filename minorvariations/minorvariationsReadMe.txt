Minor Variations
================
This plugin enables you to convert a natural minor key to either a harmonic or
melodic minor key. You can also colour the affected notes to red with or without
changing them. Also you can change the harmonic/melodic back to natural and/or
the colour of the notes back to black.

First select the measures to be converted (if no selection is made then the
whole of the score is assumed).
Select the Minor Variations plugin and a window will pop up.
The key signature shown will be the one for the score or if more than one key
is in use or a user defined one, this will be set to 'a minor'. This can
be changed.
You choose one of the following conversions:
  Harmonic - natural to harmonic (raise the natural 7th by a half note).
  Melodic - natural to melodic (raise the natural 6th and 7th when notes ascending).
  Remove Harmonic - harmonic to natural (lower the harmonic 7th).
  Remove Melodic - melodic to natural (lower the melodic 6th and 7th when notes ascending).
You can choose one of the following actions on all the affected notes:
  Mark as red (do not change the pitch of the note).
  Mark as black (do not change the pitch of the note).
  Mark as red (change the pitch of the note).
  Mark as black (change the pitch of the note).
So you can see the changes before making them and revert back to the original
notes and note colour.
Note. Only notes in the first voice are processed.
